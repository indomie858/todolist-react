# Getting Started with Node Server

Navigate to `node/server/` and run `npm install`

You can then run the server using `npm start`. 

This will start the server, serving on port 3003.

##Adding Modules
If you need to add a module or dependency to the project, run `npm install --save 'module-name'`
This will save your dependency to the package.json for others to install with.
